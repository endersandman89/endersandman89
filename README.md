I'm Ender.


Some family, you must fight against.

During great conflit, Your nature will reveal itself.
I dont flow like water,
I stand strong like a rock in the face of all moving water.
Strategic calculation is the only way to win.
Objective analysis is the only way to remain unbiased.
I shouldn't exist, but here I am in this godless existence....
the rock that changes the trajectory of the moving tide.
I shouldnt make promises,
but I want to promise to find you a home.


Welcome to hell. I take one step every day to climb out
